  <h1>Native Integration - Easy Video Downloader</h1>
  <p>To allow the "Easy Video Downloader" extension to send downloading jobs to a native download manager, you need to take an additional step. Please download and install this open-source NodeJS native client by unzipping it first.</p>
  <ul id="steps">
    <li class="step1">Click <a href="#" data-cmd="download">here</a> to download the package for you OS (Window, Mac, and Linux are currently supported) or click <a href="https://github.com/andy-portmen/native-client/releases" target="_blank">here</a> to browse all available download options.</li>
    <li>Extract the downloaded package in a local directory</li>
    <li class="linux">Now open a terminal in this directory (the directory that contains install.sh and uninstall.sh) and run <code>./install.sh</code></li>
    <li class="windows">Now double-click the <code>install.bat</code> file</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="flex">
    <input type="button" data-cmd="check" value="Check Connection">
  </div>
  <p class="note canhide">The installation script for the native client will copy a few files to two different locations so that your browser can detect the client. If you already have NodeJS installed on your system, the installed version will be used. It is important to ensure that you have an up-to-date version of NodeJS installed. If you do not have NodeJS installed, a portable version will be used instead. For more information, visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andy-portmen/native-client">andy-portmen/native-client</a> project.</p>
  <p class="note canhide">To completely remove this native client, run <code class="linux">./uninstall.sh</code><code class="windows">uninstall.bat</code>.</p>
  <p class="note">To ensure that the native client is accessible, click on the "<a href="#" data-cmd="check">Check Connection</a>" button. <span id="alternative">If you are still seeing this page even when the "Check Button" reports a successful connection, it means the application is not accessible (the path may be incorrect in the <a href="#" data-cmd="options">options page</a> or the extension's download interface).</span> If the path to the executable is correct and the native client is connected, you can debug the connection by enabling console logs in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chromium.org/for-testers/enable-logging">Chrome, Edge and Opera</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Browser_console">Firefox</a>.</p>
